# frana-verification-maps
This repository contains the code and associated files to create verification maps of freezing rain ice accumulation.

The main script to use is called verification_map_driver.py. This script allows you to select the start and end times for ice accumulation. The other script, verification_map_functions.py, will need to be updated to use your local file paths. Lastly, verification_map_functions.py will require 1-hr FRANA ice accumulation files.
